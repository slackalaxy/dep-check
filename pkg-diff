# pkg-diff: seek for rebuilt packages on pkg-get managed systems
#
# This script will compare a freshly synced PKGREPO file with a copy of
# the old one and output differences of packages found in both. It will
# distinguish between packages with a changed version/release and those
# that are at the same version but differ in their md5sum, for exmaple
# after a rebuild.
